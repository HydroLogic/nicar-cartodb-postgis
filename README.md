# Overview

This workshop is first and foremost and introduction to PostGIS and the power of geospatial processing with open source tools. To get you there quickly, we are using the CartoDB platform. CartoDB is an open source tool that uses PostGIS to create dynamic interactive maps. CartoDB runs directly in the browser, allowing us to avoid having to install PostGIS during this introduction workshop.

### Bonus

By the end of this workshop you will also have created a map with both Leaflet and Google Maps, you will have created infowindows and legends on an interactive map, and you will have created maps that you can embed and share on your websites or twitter.
